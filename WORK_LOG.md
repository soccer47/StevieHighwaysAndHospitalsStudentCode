| Sep 9 |  5:30pm-6pm   | First, I know that if the cost of a hospital isn't greater than the cost of a highway, you can just return the cost of building a hospital in every city. I will store both any possible connections to other cities and all constructed highways in arrays of integer ArrayLists. I have also realized that I can solve for the minimum cost via a for loop, by adding hospitals to every isolated city (no possible connections), building highways if any connected cities have hospitals, and otherwise building a hospital at the city. |

This means that I will use BFS to check for the closest possible city, and build roads to the city if not already constructed. If there aren't any cities with an already-constructed hospital that can be connected to the current city, I will create a hospital in the current city. |
| Sep 9 | 7:20pm-7:50pm |               I have completed my first draft of my program (it doesn't work yet, obviously). While I have managed to complete a first complete attempt at my for loop that makes sure every city has access to a hospital (adding highways and hospitals and their costs when necessary), I am now running into various bugs. At the moment, I can't figure out why I'm getting a null pointer error when referencing cities[i][0], when I'm looping through and adding every possible connection for each city to connections[city number] |
