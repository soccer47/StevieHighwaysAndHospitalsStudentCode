| Sep 9 | 9-10pm |     First, I know that if the cost of a hospital isn't greater than the cost of a highway, you can just return the cost of building a hospital in every city. I will store both any possible connections to other nodes and all constructed highways in arrays of integer ArrayLists. I have also realized that I can solve for the minimum cost via a for loop, by adding hospitals to every isolated city (no possible connections), building highways if any connected cities have hospitals, and otherwise building a hospital at the node. |
