| Sep 9  |   5:30pm-6pm    | First, I know that if the cost of a hospital isn't greater than the cost of a highway, you can just return the cost of building a hospital in every city. I will store both any possible connections to other cities and all constructed highways in arrays of integer ArrayLists. I have also realized that I can solve for the minimum cost via a for loop, by adding hospitals to every isolated city (no possible connections), building highways if any connected cities have hospitals, and otherwise building a hospital at the city. |
| Sep 9  |  6:05pm-6:30pm  |                                                                    I think that I can use a similar approach to what I did in the snakes and ladders problem set in order to get the closest city with a hospital to the current city (if possible). This means that I will use BFS to check for the closest possible city, and build roads to the city if not already constructed. If there aren't any cities with an already-constructed hospital that can be connected to the current city, I will create a hospital in the current city. |
| Sep 9  |  7:20pm-7:50pm  |               I have completed my first draft of my program (it doesn't work yet, obviously). While I have managed to complete a first complete attempt at my for loop that makes sure every city has access to a hospital (adding highways and hospitals and their costs when necessary), I am now running into various bugs. At the moment, I can't figure out why I'm getting a null pointer error when referencing cities[i][0], when I'm looping through and adding every possible connection for each city to connections[city number] |
| Sep 10 |  12pm-12:30pm   |                                                               I have fixed the null pointer error I was getting previously. I am now able to pass 3 of the 6 cases without error, however for the 3 bigger tests I am getting negative numbers when they should instead be large positive numbers. I think this is because I'm overcounting, and thereby am wrapping around when I exceed the highest possible integer. I also think this probably has something to do with my BFS path finder to get to the city with the nearest hospital. |
| Sep 10 |  7:25pm-7:55pm  |                                            I have continued to debug my code. I have made a few small debugs that I think have gotten me closer to a functional algorithm, however I am still overcounting, but now for 4 of the tests, not 3. I'm still not sure why, however I still think its almost certainly the BFS search to identify the closest city. I have also realized that connecting to a city that already has access to a city with a hospital is essentially the same thing as connecting to a city with its own hospital. |
| Sep 11 | 10:55am-11:25am |                                                                                                                                                    I have realized that BFS takes too long when dealing with bigger test cases. I have therefore decided to switch to an approach that identifies the number of clusters, and the number of cities per clusters. I will then be able to return cost as the (hospitalCost * number of clusters) + (highwayCost * highways needed for clusters). I think this way will be much more efficient. |
