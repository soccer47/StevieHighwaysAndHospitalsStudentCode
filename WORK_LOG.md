| Sep 9 |  5:30pm-6pm   | First, I know that if the cost of a hospital isn't greater than the cost of a highway, you can just return the cost of building a hospital in every city. I will store both any possible connections to other cities and all constructed highways in arrays of integer ArrayLists. I have also realized that I can solve for the minimum cost via a for loop, by adding hospitals to every isolated city (no possible connections), building highways if any connected cities have hospitals, and otherwise building a hospital at the city. |

This means that I will use BFS to check for the closest possible city, and build roads to the city if not already constructed. If there aren't any cities with an already-constructed hospital that can be connected to the current city, I will create a hospital in the current city. |
